Changelog

27/06/22

- First quick port of T3X/Z V16 to RSX180/280. Runtime library ported, except
  for the t_bdos and t_bdoshl functions.

- Summary output only if /V is specified on the command line (thus, no longer
  output by default, to match the "silent" behavior of RSX applications).

- Prefix error messages with 'T3X -- ' as per RSX conventions.

- Default to .T3X file extension.

- Generate task file header:
  * Remember top of text segment after first pass so we can initialize the
    header fields accordingly.
  * Use the file name as default task name.
  * The file is created non-contiguous as the necessary library support is
    not there yet.


28/06/22

- Close Infile and Outfile on error to avoid RSX180/280 complaining about
  about "exit with outstanding I/O".

- Create output file only during the second pass, else RSX will produce two
  versions of the file.

- CG_HALT now passes the argument of the 'halt' statement to the exit routine.

- First successful compilation of the compiler under RSX180/280!

- The default ("success") exit code under RSX180/280 is 1 and not 0 (0 means
  "warning").


01/07/22

- Report code and data size, number of symbols, etc. as unsigned decimal.


02/07/22

- Working on a new version that generates REL files:
  * added REL-output routines.
  * use two unused SFLAGS bits for segment information.
  * globaddr() now allocates space in data segment, and no longer in code
    segment with a relative jump to get around the data; CG_RJUMP became
    obsolete and was removed.
  * gen() function expanded to handle segment information.
  * removed emitlib() since the Run-Time library is now added at the link
    phase.
  * the Run-Time library is now a separate REL library, mklib no longer
    needed.


10/07/22

- Generate external references for Run-Time library calls. Pointers to the
  corresponding symbol table entries are now kept in a separate table to
  make chain address handling easier (saves a symbol table lookup.)


21/07/22

- New symbol 'class' and 'object' types, taken from the PC compiler version.
  Class members can be constants or functions at this point, not variables.
  Due to REL name length limitations, external function names are aliased to
  a shorter name, invisible to the compiled program (before, T.* methods were
  entered into the symbol table as simple identifiers resolving to a fixed
  library address)

- Chain externals when calling external object methods.


22/07/22

- Emit an external call to the initialization library code, do not assume
  that the main program begins at zero (code-relative) address.

- Place constant strings, byte vectors and tables on data segment. This
  eliminates the jump-around instruction required when those are placed in
  the code segment, resulting in smaller code.

- Module statement now sets REL module name.

- First working version!

- Don't add 't' object by default; create it in object_decl();


23/07/22

- Remove redundant jump-around instructions.

- Added 'external' keyword to allow calling external assembly-language
  functions.


03/12/23

- Added V19 changes (compound statements now deallocate local storage when
  exiting via LEAVE or LOOP).
